--- SELECT -------------->>>>>>>>>

--- 1. Fetch all of the data from the table.

SELECT * FROM students;

--- 2. Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names.

SELECT str_stulast_name, str_stufirst_name FROM students;

--- 3.1. Fetch the student which id is equal to 2.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE lg_stuid = 2;

--- 3.2. Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE str_stulast_name = 'Benichou' AND str_stufirst_name = 'Marc';

--- 3.3. Fetch the students whose last_names are Benichou OR first_names are Marc.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE str_stulast_name = 'Benichou' OR str_stufirst_name = 'Marc';

--- 3.4. Fetch the students whose first_names contain the letter a.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE str_stufirst_name LIKE '%a%';

--- 3.5. Fetch the students whose first_names start with the letter a.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE str_stufirst_name LIKE 'a%';

--- 3.6. Fetch the students whose first_names end with the letter a.

SELECT * FROM students WHERE str_stufirst_name LIKE '%a';

--- 3.7. Fetch the students whose second to last letter of their first_names are a (Example: Leah).
